              <h2>What is SQL?</h2>
              <p>Data is a core part of many web applications and mobile apps. For example, an application like Facebook holds a user’s profile information, including data about their friends and posts. To hold this data, a database system is used. SQL is a programming language that enables programmers to work with that data.</p>

          <h2>History</h2>
          <br>
          <p>SQL was first developed in the early 1970s by IBM researchers Raymond Boyce and Donald Chamberlin. It was initially called SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language) and was designed to manipulate and retrieve data in IBM’s database management system, System R. </p>
            <br>
            <p>
          In the late 70s, Relational Software, Inc. (now Oracle) was inspired to create their own version and introduced the first commercially available implementation of SQL.
          By 1986, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) had adopted a standard definition of SQL.

              <ul>
                <li>Faster Query Processing </li>
                 <p> Large amount of data is retrieved quickly and efficiently. Operations like Insertion, deletion, manipulation of data is also done in almost no time. </p>
                <li>No Coding Skills  </li>
                 <p>For data retrieval, large number of lines of code is not required. All basic keywords such as SELECT, INSERT INTO, UPDATE, etc are used and also the syntactical rules are not complex in SQL, which makes it a user-friendly language. <p>

                 <p>SQL has a difficult interface that makes few users uncomfortable while dealing with the database. 
                <li>Cost </li>
                <p>Some versions are costly and hence, programmers cannot access it.  </p>
                <li>Partial Control</li>
                 <p>Due to hidden business rules, complete control is not given to the database. </p>

          <center><h2>How SQL works:</h2></center>
          <br>
          <p>SQL uses a set of commands to manipulate the data in databases. Examples include SQL INSERT, which is used to add data to database tables; SQL SELECT, which retrieves data from database tables; and SQL UPDATE, which modifies existing database records.</p>
          <br>
          <p>SQL is the most common language for extracting and organising data that is stored in a relational database. A database is a table that consists of rows and columns. SQL is the language of databases. It facilitates retrieving specific information from databases that are further used for analysis.</p>
