              <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
              <p>It is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colours, layout, and fonts, thus making our web pages presentable to the users.</p>
              <p>CSS is designed to make style sheets for the web. It is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language. Now letâ€™s try to break the acronym:</p>

                  <li>Style: Adding designs/Styling our HTML tags</li>
                  <li>Sheets: Writing our style in different documents</li>

              <h2>Uses & Purpose</h2>
              <p>CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language.</p>

          <h2>History</h2>
          <br>
          <p><b>CSS</b> (1996) allows the user to select font style and size and change the colour of the text and background.</p>
          <p><b>CSS2</b> (1998) has capabilities that allows the user to design page layout.</p>
          <p><b>CSS3</b> (1999) allows the user to create presentations from documents and to select from a wider range of fonts including those from Google and Typecast. Uniquely, CSS3 allows the user to incorporate rounded borders and use multiple columns. CSS3 is considered to be easier to use (when compared to CSS2) because it has different modules.</p>

            <h2>Advantages of CSS:</h2>
            <br>
              <ul>
                <li>Using CSS you simply got to specify a repeated style for element once & use it multiple times as because CSS will automatically apply the required styles.</li>
                <li>Style is applied consistently across variety of sites. One instruction can control several areas which is advantageous</li>
                <li>Web designers needs to use few lines of programming for every page improving site speed</li>
                <li>Cascading sheet not only simplifies website development, but also simplifies the maintenance as a change of one line of code affects the whole web site and maintenance time.</li>
                <li>It is less complex therefore the effort are significantly reduced.</li>
              </ul>

            <h2>Disadvantages of CSS:</h2>
            <br>
              <ul>
                <li>CSS, CSS 1 up to CSS3, result in creating of confusion among  web browsers</li>
                <li>With CSS, what works with one browser might not always work with another. The web developers need to test for compatibility, running the program across multiple browsers.</li>
                <li>There exists a scarcity of security.</li>
                <li>The programing language world is complicated for non-developers and beginners. Different levels of CSS i.e. CSS, CSS 2, CSS 3 are often quite confusing.</li>

          <center><h2>How CSS works:</h2></center>
          <br>
          <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>
