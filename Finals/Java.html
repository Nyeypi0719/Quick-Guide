              <h2>What is Java?</h2>
              <p>Java is a class-based, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language meant to have fewer implementation dependencies. It is an infrastructure for application development. Java is so quick, secure, and dependable. It is commonly employed in the development of Java applications for laptops, data centers, game consoles, scientific supercomputers, mobile phones, etc.</p>

              <h2>Uses & Purpose</h2>
              <p>Java is used by developers to build applications for laptops, data centers, game consoles, scientific supercomputers, mobile phones, and other devices. Java is the third most used programming language in the world, after Python and C, according to the TIOBE programming language popularity index.</p>

          <h2>History</h2>
          <br>
          <p>Java was first released in 1995, and Java’s ability to provide interactivity and multimedia showed that it was particularly well suited for the Web.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
            James Gosling headed a team of researchers at Sun Microsystems, Inc. in an endeavor to design a new language that would allow consumer electrical gadgets to speak with one another. Work on the language began in 1991, but the company quickly shifted its attention to a new niche: the World Wide Web. James Gosling initiated Java language project in June 1991 for use in one of his many set-top box projects. The language, initially called 'Oak' after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office, also went by the name 'Green' and ended up later being renamed as Java, from a list of random words.

            <br>
              <ul>
                <li>It is object-oriented. This allows you to create modular programs and reusable code.</li>
                <li>It is platform-independent.</li>

            <h2>Disadvantages of Java : </h2>
            <br>
              <ul>
                <li>Java needs to be interpreted during runtime, which allows it to run on every operating system, but it also makes it perform slower than the languages.</li>
                <li>Java program consumes more memory since it runs on top of Java virtual machine.</li>
                <li>Java provides automatic garbage collection that cannot be controlled by the programmer.</li>

          <center><h2>How Java works:</h2></center>
          <br>
          <p>Java works in the same way, compiling source code into bytecode first. The Java Virtual Machine can then compile the bytecode into machine code (JVM). The JVM allows Java’s bytecode to execute on any device, which is why it’s known as a “write once, run anywhere” language.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Java was able to eliminate the platform issue for high-level programmers by reorganizing the compiler's compile-link-execute process at an underlying level. The details are difficult, but the creators of the Java language isolated those programming issues that are platform-dependent and built low-level techniques to abstractly refer to these issues. As a result, the Java compiler does not generate an object file, but rather a bytecode file, which is effectively an object file for a virtual machine. In fact, the Java compiler is frequently referred to as the JVM compiler (for Java Virtual Machine).</p>
