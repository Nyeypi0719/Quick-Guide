              <h2>What is Python?</h2>
              <p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together.</p>

              <h2>Uses & Purpose</h2>
              <p>Python is commonly used for developing websites and software, task automation, data analysis, and data visualization. Since it's relatively easy to learn, Python has been adopted by many non-programmers such as accountants and scientists, for a variety of everyday tasks, like organizing finances.</p>

          <h2>History</h2>
          <br>
          <p>
            Python was created by Guido van Rossum, and first released on February 20, 1991. While you may know the python as a large snake, the name of the Python programming language comes from an old BBC television comedy sketch series called Monty Python’s Flying Circus.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>One of the amazing features of Python is the fact that it is actually one person’s work. Usually, new programming languages are developed and published by large companies employing lots of professionals, and due to copyright rules, it is very hard to name any of the people involved in the project. Python is an exception. Python is omnipresent, and people use numerous Python-powered devices on a daily basis, whether they realize it or not. There are billions of lines of code written in Python, which means almost unlimited opportunities for code reuse and learning from well-crafted examples. What’s more, there is a large and very active Python community, always happy to help.</p>

            <h2>Advantages of Python:</h2>
            <br>
              <ul>
                <li>Python is straightforward to use. It is a high-level programming language, and its syntax is like the English language. </li>
                <li>This language is very flexible, and hence it allows the user to try new things. The users can develop new sorts of the application using Python</li>
                <li>Python’s standard library is massive, and just about every function one needs to perform is available in its library.</li>

            <h2>Disadvantages of Python: </h2>
            <br>
              <ul>
                <li>Compared to Java or C, the rate of Python is slower. Python is an interpreted language that is dynamically typed.</li>
                <li>Python consumes a large amount of memory. This is due to its adaptability to data types. It consumes a lot of memory.</li>
                <li>Python is strong in server platforms and desktops, and hence it is a fantastic server-side programming language. But it is not appropriate for mobile development.</li>

          <center><h2>How Phyton works:</h2></center>
          <br>
          <p>Python is an object-oriented programming language like Java. Python is called an interpreted language. Python uses code modules that are interchangeable instead of a single long list of instructions that was standard for functional programming languages. The standard implementation of python is called “cpython”. It is the default and widely used implementation of Python.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Python doesn’t convert its code into machine code, something that hardware can understand. It actually converts it into something called byte code. So within python, compilation happens, but it’s just not into a machine language. It is into byte code (.pyc or .pyo) and this byte code can’t be understood by the CPU. So we need an interpreter called the python virtual machine to execute the byte codes.</p>
