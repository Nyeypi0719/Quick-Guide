              <h2>What is PHP?</h2>
              <p>PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is known as a general-purpose scripting language that can be used to develop dynamic and interactive websites. It was among the first server-side languages that could be embedded into HTML, making it easier to add functionality to web pages without needing to call external files for data.</p>

          <h2>History</h2>
          <br>
          <p>
            PHP as it's known today is actually the successor to a product named PHP/FI. Created in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf, the very first incarnation of PHP was a simple set of Common Gateway Interface (CGI) binaries written in the C programming language. Originally used for tracking visits to his online resume, he named the suite of scripts "Personal Home Page Tools," more frequently referenced as "PHP Tools." Over time, more functionality was desired, and Rasmus rewrote PHP Tools, producing a much larger and richer implementation. This new model was capable of database interaction and more, providing a framework upon which users could develop simple dynamic web applications such as guestbooks.

          <center><h2>How PHP works:</h2></center>
          <br>
          <p>The PHP programme interacts with the site server, which is the programme that sends out web pages to the rest of the world. When you type a URL into the address bar of your web browser, you’re telling the web server at that URL to email you an HTML file. The requested file is sent by the web server in response. The HTML file is read by your browser, and then shows the web page. When you press a source on a web page, you’re also requesting a file from the web server. Additionally, when you press a web page button that submits a form, the web server processes a file. When PHP is mounted, the procedure is exactly the same. You submit a file, and the web server, which happens to be running PHP, responds with HTML, because of PHP it all happens.</p>
